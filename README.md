# Malloc-2
My own implementation of malloc function using *sbrk*.


* sbrk : The brk and sbrk calls dynamically change the amount of space allocated for the data segment of the calling process. The change is
made by resetting the program break of the process, which determines the maximum space that can be allocated.
